# Peak fitting (core, EDC, MDC)

PyARPES-only peak fits. Do **not** invent lineshapes or fit engines. Thin glue
that **calls** package APIs is OK; any new model → ask first (`package-first.md`).

**Docs:** [Curve fitting](https://arpes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curve-fitting.html) ·
[XPS example](https://arpes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/full-analysis-xps.html)

Complete load/inspect first (`safe-reduction.md`). For folder work, prefer
manifest recall (`folder-manifest.md`).

## Shared rules (all fit kinds)

1. Name the **lineshape(s)** and **background** every time.  
2. Report **center**, **width** (state σ / γ / FWHM), **amplitude** (or area).  
3. State energy convention (Ek / Eb / E−EF).  
4. Use **only** package models unless user approves new code.  
5. Save fit params / figures under `analysis/`; do not dump huge residuals into chat
   (`token-usage.md`).

### Package models (common)

| Model | Import | Typical use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Gaussian | `arpes.fits.fit_models.GaussianModel` | Core / instrument-dominated |
| Lorentzian | `arpes.fits.fit_models.LorentzianModel` | Lifetime-dominated valence |
| Voigt | `arpes.fits.fit_models.VoigtModel` | Mixed instrument + lifetime |
| Affine background | `arpes.fits.fit_models.AffineBackgroundModel` | Linear/const background |
| Multi-peak | Sum with `prefix=` e.g. `GaussianModel(prefix="a_") + …` | Several lines at once |
| Broadcast | `arpes.fits.utilities.broadcast_model` | Same model along 1+ dims |

**Fermi edge** (not a core/valence peak): `AffineBroadenedFD` / step models — see
k-conversion EF finder; do not use as a core peak model. For **metal-referenced
near-EF / gap / pseudogap** on cuts (FD divide, symmetrize) see
`near-ef-gap.md` — user-asked only.

**Doniach–Šunjić / exotic XPS shapes:** check whether they exist in the installed
`arpes.fits.fit_models` before claiming. If missing → **ask** before writing a
custom lineshape.

## 1. Core-level fitting (first)

### When

- Suspected **core-as-2D** (`default-overview-plots.md`), or user asks for core /
  XPS / element edge fits.
- Input is usually an **angle-integrated** (or spatially selected) **EDC-like**
  curve vs energy — not a dispersing valence band fit.

### Pipeline (package only)

```text
identify core / core-as-2D
  → angle-integrate (mean/sum over detector) if still 2D
  → state energy axis; select ROI in eV around the core(s)
  → optional Shirley: arpes.analysis.shirley.remove_shirley_background
  → compose peaks + background (Gaussian/Voigt + AffineBackgroundModel, …)
  → guess_fit on one curve; report lineshape + params
  → optional broadcast_model across x/y (or other dims) with params hints
  → save results under analysis/
```

```python
from arpes.fits.fit_models import GaussianModel, AffineBackgroundModel
from arpes.analysis.shirley import remove_shirley_background
from arpes.fits.utilities import broadcast_model, result_to_hints

# core_edc: 1D intensity vs eV (after angle integrate if needed)
roi = core_edc.sel(eV=slice(e_lo, e_hi))  # state window
clean = remove_shirley_background(roi)  # optional; state if used

model = (
    AffineBackgroundModel()
    + GaussianModel(prefix="a_")
    + GaussianModel(prefix="b_")
)
result = model.guess_fit(
    clean - clean.min(),  # follow XPS example patterns as appropriate
    params={
        "a_center": {"value": c1},
        "b_center": {"value": c2},
    },
)
print(result.fit_report())

# Optional map broadcast (nano-XPS style) — token note if many pixels
# results = broadcast_model(
#     [GaussianModel, GaussianModel],
#     bkg_removed_map,
#     ["x", "y"],
#     params=result_to_hints(result),
# )
```

### Core reporting extras

- Element / edge name if known (user or log) — do not invent assignments.  
- Shirley (or other) background: **on/off** and ROI.  
- Spin–orbit pair constraints only if user/package params set them — state them.
  Full **Spin-ARPES / SARPES** (up/down channels, polarization plots) →
  `spin-arpes.md`.  
- Link to core-as-2D overview PNGs / manifest row when present.

### Do not

- Run valence **k-conversion** as part of core fitting by default.  
- Invent Doniach–Šunjić or SO splitting if not in package / user input.  
- Fit the full deep survey without an explicit energy ROI when many edges exist —
  ask which edge(s).

## 2. EDC and MDC fitting

After safe-reduction step 5 (extract EDC/MDC with stated window).

### EDC vs MDC

| Curve | Fixed axis | Best for |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **EDC** | fixed k (or angle) | Energy distribution, gaps / pseudogap (`near-ef-gap.md`), binding shifts |
| **MDC** | fixed E | Dispersion E(k), velocity, FS crossings |

- Prefer **MDC** for band tracking / E(k).  
- Prefer **EDC** for energy-distribution at one k.  
- **Several lines at once:** compose prefixed models on one curve (same as core).

### Single-curve fit

```python
from arpes.fits.fit_models import LorentzianModel  # or VoigtModel, GaussianModel

result = LorentzianModel().guess_fit(edc_or_mdc)
print(result.fit_report())
```

Do not claim quasiparticle lifetime from Lorentzian width without assumptions
(temperature, matrix elements, impurity scattering, etc.).

### Broadcast fits (dispersion / parameter maps)

```python
from arpes.fits.utilities import broadcast_model
from arpes.fits.fit_models import LorentzianModel

fit_results = broadcast_model(LorentzianModel, data_2d, "eV")  # use real dim name
```

- `"eV"` → fit MDCs vs energy (typical dispersion track).  
- Momentum / `phi` / `pixel` → fit EDCs vs that axis.  
- Multi-peak: pass a list of model classes or a composite, with `params=`.

### Derived plots (after broadcast) — defaults

After a valence **broadcast** fit, always save follow-up curves under `analysis/`
(and link in the report). Do not stop at raw `fit_report` text.

#### Which plots (by mode)

| Broadcast mode | Required by default | Also recommended |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **MDC vs E** (dispersion track) | **E vs k** (peak centers) · **width vs k** | **width vs E** |
| **EDC vs k** | **width vs E** | center vs k; width vs k if useful |

Single-curve fit only → plot data + model (+ residual); **no** E(k) / vF / m*
until a broadcast (or user-supplied) dispersion exists.

Extract centers/widths from broadcast results (e.g. `.F.p("center")` /
width params — inspect structure for the installed PyARPES version). Label axes
with units; state lineshape and whether width is σ, γ, or FWHM.

#### Second-stage band fit on E vs k (physics)

When **E vs k** centers exist (prefer after **k-conversion**; if still angle,
label provisional and ask to convert):

1. Overlay a smooth band using **package models only**:
   - `LinearModel` near EF → **Fermi velocity**
   - `QuadraticModel` / parabola near band extremum → **effective mass**
2. If linear vs parabolic is unclear → **ask** (do not invent higher-order bands).
3. Fit only inside a stated **k window** (and note E range).

| Quantity | How | Report |
|----------|-----|--------|
| **vF** | Slope of linear E(k) near EF | Value + units (e.g. eV·Å or m/s — state conversion) |
| **m\*** | Curvature of \(E \approx E_0 + \hbar^2 (k-k_0)^2/(2m^*)\) | In m_e; state formula used |
| **kF / k0 / E0** | Intercept / vertex from the same fit | With method |

Use PyARPES/`lmfit` models already in the stack (e.g. `LinearModel`,
`QuadraticModel`).

**Self-energy (Σ):** when the user asks for Σ / ReΣ–ImΣ / quasiparticle lifetime
from a **single-band** cut → `reference/self-energy.md` (path C: reuse MDC
broadcast if present, else `fit_for_self_energy`; bare band default
`ransac_linear`). Not part of the default EDC/MDC report.

#### Caveats

- Resolution and lineshape choice bias vF and m* — state assumptions.  
- Width → lifetime only with explicit assumptions (see above).  
- No freestyle tight-binding / custom Hamiltonian unless user chooses
  package-first (C).

Warn before large broadcasts (`token-usage.md`).

## Checklist before reporting

### Core

1. Curve is angle-integrated (or stated spatial ROI), not treated as valence cut.  
2. Energy ROI stated; Shirley on/off stated.  
3. Lineshape(s) + background named; centers/widths/amplitudes reported.  
4. No invent element assignment or exotic lineshape.

### EDC / MDC

1. EDC/MDC extracted with stated window.  
2. Lineshape + background named.  
3. Center/width/amplitude reported (σ/γ/FWHM clear).  
4. Broadcast: mode stated; **default derived plots** saved (E vs k / width vs k /
   width vs E as required above).  
5. If E vs k available: linear or parabolic band fit (ask which) → report **vF**
   and/or **m\*** with units + k window — or state skipped with reason.  
6. No lifetime claims without assumptions.
